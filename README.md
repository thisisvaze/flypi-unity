# Circuit Sketch VR

An innovative VR-based educational tool that brings hand-drawn electronic circuits to life using Meta Quest 3.

## Overview

Circuit Sketch VR is an interactive educational tool designed to help students learn electronics in an immersive and engaging way. Using a Meta Quest 3 headset, students can draw electronic circuits on paper with a pen, and watch as their sketches transform into interactive 3D models powered by LLaMA AI.

## Features

- **Sketch Recognition**: Draw electronic circuits on paper and have them recognized in real-time
- **3D Visualization**: See your circuits come to life as interactive 3D models in VR
- **Interactive Learning**: Manipulate and experiment with your circuits in a virtual environment
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes LLaMA AI for accurate circuit recognition and interpretation
- **Meta Quest 3 Integration**: Takes advantage of the Meta Quest 3's advanced mixed reality capabilities
